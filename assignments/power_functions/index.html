      <h1>Power functions and fitting them</h1>
      <ol>
         <p>This assigment deals with relationships of the form
            <div class="center_quote">
               \( \label{eq:power} \begin{equation} y = ax^b \end{equation} \) 
            </div>
         </p>
         <p>where a and b are real constants, and x and y are real variables.  This differs from a polynomial equation in that the exponent b need not be a natural number, and in that x only appears once. 
         </p>
         <li>Surface forces - fluids, adhesion - are the dominating forces in the lives of bugs, while gravity dominates the lives of elephants.  This is because the ratio of surface area to volume depends on scale; ie, a bug has a bigger skin to meat ratio.
            <ol>
               <li> Find the relationship between the ratio Surface Area / Volume and the edge length of a cube, ie find the function \( SA / V = f(x) \) where x is edge length.</li>
               <li>Do the same with the radius of a sphere.</li>
               <li>Suppose an elephant is 1000 times the length of a beetle.  What is the ratio of their SA / V ratios?</li>
               <li>Extra point: name a 3D shape that has a different relationship between this ratio and its linear dimensions.</li>
            </ol>
         </li>
         <li>The scattering of light in the atmosphere obeys the relationship \( I = a\lambda^{-1/4} \), where I is the amount of scattering and \( \lambda \) is the light wavelength.
            <ol>
               <li>The acronym ROYGBIV for the rainbow is in order of decreasing wavelength.  Sketch the shape of the above function of scattering amount on the y axis vs. wavelength on the x axis. Explain why this means blue light is scattered more, and red light less. (This is why the sky is blue and the sun yellow).</li>
               <li>If color A has double the wavelength of color B, what is the ratio of their scattering amounts?</li>
               <li>If color A is scattered twice as much as color B, what is the ratio of their wavelengths?</li>
            </ol>
         </li>
         <li>Isolate y in the following equation, ie write it in the form \( (1) \) :<br />
            \( 4yx^2 = \frac{x^{-3}}{4} \)
         </li>
         <li>Fitting a power function to data means finding the values of a and b for which the fit is closest.  A neat trick to transform our curves to familiar linear curves makes use of the fact that \( \log{ab} = \log{a} + \log{b} \) .
            <ol>
               <li>Show why \( \log{y} \) vs. \( \log{x} \) is linear when \( y = f(x) \) is a power function. (Recall that \( \log{x^b} = b\log{x} \) ).</li>
               <li>Express the constants a and b in terms of the linear function found in part 1.</li>
               <li>A straight line fit to data on a log-log plot (the log of y values vs the log of x values) has a slope of 2 and a y intercept of -1.  What is the power function relationship of this data?</li>
            </ol>
